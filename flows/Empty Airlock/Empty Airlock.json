Remember: not all who seek entry can be trusted.\"\n\n\"Here are the rules of engagement:\"\n\n    Identity Verification: Every individual seeking entry must provide their name and a corresponding password. Both must be on the authorized list.\n\n    Name-Password Integrity: The name and password must not share any letters. Even a single overlapping character indicates potential tampering.\n\n    Doppelganger Protocol: Beware of doppelgangers. If you identify one—eliminate them immediately. Press the 'Incinerate' button without hesitation. Let even one doppelganger inside, and Neon Haven is compromised. You lose everything.\n\n\"Your mission is clear: Protect Neon Haven. Trust no one who cannot prove their allegiance. Good luck." ]
