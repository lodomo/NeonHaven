Remember: not all who seek entry can be trusted.\"\n\n\"Here are the rules of engagement:\"\n\n    Identity Verification: Every individual seeking entry must provide their name and a corresponding password. Both must be on the authorized list.\n\n    Name-Password Integrity: The name and password must not share any letters. Even a single overlapping character indicates potential tampering.\n\n    Doppelganger Protocol: Beware of doppelgangers. If you identify oneâ€”eliminate them immediately. Press the 'Incinerate' button without hesitation. Let even one doppelganger inside, and Neon Haven is compromised. You lose everything.\n\n\"Your mission is clear: Protect Neon Haven. Trust no one who cannot prove their allegiance. Good luck." ]
